# Algorithm Tour repository

## Timeframe
December 18 2018 - January 26, 2019

## Goal
Build up confidence in the syntax of Java 8 (and then 9 -- in another
branch) without an IDE. Create the following components more or less
from memory, or with only memory cues or scripting, so that I am clear
that I understand the principles of their construction.

1. Java classes
1. Java classes and interfaces in hierarchy
1. A maven pom file
1. Test configuration
1. JPA entities, an initial postgres load
1. A spring boot application
1. Server configuration
1. Jenkins configuration.

This is probably as much as I can do in the time frame.  The goal is
to make a sample application, sample classes, and lessons that will
bring somebody who has learned basic Java (maybe a 50 hour course) to
be able to add controllers to a spring application, assuming those
controllers are similar to an existing one.
